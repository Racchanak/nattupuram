							<h2>Shipping Mode: Standard Shipping - Surface By Road</h2>
							<p>All products are either delivered by Nattupuram staff or by reputed courier Companies. Normally for orders placed before 12 PM on a business day, we aim to ship the same day, provided that the card security checks are complete, payment is received and the stock availability is confirmed. Orders placed after 12 PM will be shipped the next business day. Orders Received on Sunday or during Holidays are dispatched the following Monday or the next working day. During busy times, such as holiday periods, there can be processing and shipping delays. The orders cannot be shipped to PO boxes or military addresses, and rural domestic addresses require one or more additional days to deliver. If your location is not serviced by our courier, we will contact you for other possibilities or to cancel the order and full amount will be refunded to your account. If in any case you receive a package which is damaged during transit then please do not accept it. You can return the same and contact us asking for another piece. Please follow the same in case you've received an incorrect product and we would accept it only if you wouldn't open the packaging. We will try our level best to send you a replacement as soon as possible. </p> <br>
